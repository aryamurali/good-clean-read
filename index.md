## Rethink's Women in Tech Learning Program is a 4 week learning program for female engineering students, designed to equip them to leverage the various Women in Tech opportunities.

### Premise

There are a number of excellent opportunities for female engineering students out there. These opportunities mostly provide financial aid for young, smart women to pursue technology, and also facilitate mentorship/industry connect for them to excel in their career.

**Some of the existing brilliant opportunities for women in tech in India are:**

1.  GHC Student Scholarship
2.  Facebook-GHC Scholarship
3.  GHC India Student Scholarship
4.  WeTech Qualcomm Global Scholarship
5.  Adobe Women in Tech Scholarship
6.  Google Women Techmakers Scholarship
7.  Western Digital Scholarships for STEM
8.  Rails Girls Summer of Code
9.  Outreachy

**Most of our girls do not apply to these programs NOT because they do not have the merit to get selected but mostly because:**

-   _They are not aware about these opportunities._
-   _They do not know how to go about the application process._
-   _They don't believe that they can get selected._

This is where our Learning Program comes in to facilitate information, guidance and support in equipping them with the necessary skills to apply to opportunities such as above and get selected.

**If you are a female engineering student, this program is for you**. The program has been curated based on the learning and insights from over 100 girls who have nailed these opportunities.

It is going to be a 4-week hustle to improve your confidence and skills in applying to these opportunities. You can expect to have super interactive, fun activities paired with peer-learning throughout the course. You will also receive access to the previous winners of these programs and learn from the winners themselves. By the end of the program, you can expect to be aware of the various WIT Opportunities, how you can discover them, how you can put in a winning application and how you can improve your profile so you stand a better chance at getting selected.


### Program Details

#### Program Pre-requisites

Our learning program will be conducted online. All our key communication will be facilitated over email and our discussions will happen on telegram, which is why it is imperative that you regularly check your email inbox and also have a telegram account.

So, it is mandatory that you have:

-   Access to a laptop/desktop
-   Access to reliable internet connection
-   A telegram account
-   A working email address

  

#### Feel free to apply if,

-   You're interested in applying to WIT Opportunities

What you can expect is a series of fun activities to understand each of the topics above. When it comes to applying to opportunities, there is no one right answer. It is always about perspectives and how you approach these opportunities. This is why you will have a more hands-on experience and will rely heavily on peer-learning/discussions to form perspectives. We will also look to rope in previous winners of these opportunities so they can share their approach, perspectives, learnings and experiences that helped them get selected.
