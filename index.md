## Rethink's Women in Tech Learning Program is a 4 week learning program for female engineering students, designed to equip them to leverage the various Women in Tech opportunities.

### Premise

There are a number of excellent opportunities for female engineering students out there. These opportunities mostly provide financial aid for young, smart women to pursue technology, and also facilitate mentorship/industry connect for them to excel in their career.

**Some of the existing brilliant opportunities for women in tech in India are:**

1.  GHC Student Scholarship
2.  Facebook-GHC Scholarship
3.  GHC India Student Scholarship
4.  WeTech Qualcomm Global Scholarship
5.  Adobe Women in Tech Scholarship
6.  Google Women Techmakers Scholarship
7.  Western Digital Scholarships for STEM
8.  Rails Girls Summer of Code
9.  Outreachy

**Most of our girls do not apply to these programs NOT because they do not have the merit to get selected but mostly because:**

-   _They are not aware about these opportunities._
-   _They do not know how to go about the application process._
-   _They don't believe that they can get selected._

This is where our Learning Program comes in to facilitate information, guidance and support in equipping them with the necessary skills to apply to opportunities such as above and get selected.

**If you are a female engineering student, this program is for you**. The program has been curated based on the learning and insights from over 100 girls who have nailed these opportunities.

It is going to be a 4-week hustle to improve your confidence and skills in applying to these opportunities. You can expect to have super interactive, fun activities paired with peer-learning throughout the course. You will also receive access to the previous winners of these programs and learn from the winners themselves. By the end of the program, you can expect to be aware of the various WIT Opportunities, how you can discover them, how you can put in a winning application and how you can improve your profile so you stand a better chance at getting selected.


### Program Details

#### Program Pre-requisites

Our learning program will be conducted online. All our key communication will be facilitated over email and our discussions will happen on telegram, which is why it is imperative that you regularly check your email inbox and also have a telegram account.

So, it is mandatory that you have:

-   Access to a laptop/desktop
-   Access to reliable internet connection
-   A telegram account
-   A working email address

  

#### Feel free to apply if,

-   You're interested in applying to WIT Opportunities
-   You're committed to learning and improving your skills
-   You're open and willing to share your learning and experiences

  

#### In the program, we will cover,

-   Discovering Opportunities
-   Validating Opportunities
-   Writing Application Essays
-   Building your Resume
-   Seeking Recommendation Letters
-   Getting your Application Reviewed
-   Improving your Profile
-   Building an Online Presence

What you can expect is a series of fun activities to understand each of the topics above. When it comes to applying to opportunities, there is no one right answer. It is always about perspectives and how you approach these opportunities. This is why you will have a more hands-on experience and will rely heavily on peer-learning/discussions to form perspectives. We will also look to rope in previous winners of these opportunities so they can share their approach, perspectives, learnings and experiences that helped them get selected.

To know more about why we rely on peer-learning, checkout [this blog.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.rethinkfoundation.in%2Frethinks-learning-community-d712bfa52243&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEuJB3XQT4ydEO7CD5p9tQAbSenBQ) 

#### During the program, you will be expected to

-   Actively participate in all discussions and activities.
-   Maintain weekly TWTWs.

(TWTW stands for **T**he **W**eek **T**hat **W**as and is a summary of your learning and experiences through the week. Checkout some sample TWTWs [**here**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DTWTW&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGVbnxoKNsA1aWlfhe-tJJjU6H8-A))

## Application Process
As with every opportunity, we also have an application process. The purpose of this process is for us to know slightly more about you as a person and what your aspirations in life are. 

Your application to the program happens in two stages:

1. You record your interest.

2. You fill the application form.

**Stage 1 (Recording your interest)** happens on Telegram. We use our Rethink Bot on telegram to create your profile with us and capture your interest in the program. Once you create your profile, you will receive a **Profile Reference Number(PRN)** along with the main application form. This is a number unique to you and will be asked for in the main application.

**Stage 2 (You filling the main application)** happens through a Google Form. After creating your profile, you get the link to the main application form. You can enter the PRN you receive when you create your profile with us and fill in the remaining application. Upon successful submission of the application, you'll receive a confirmation email from us.

Remember, if your PRN is invalid, your application submission will also be considered invalid.

#### How to set up your profile with us

Here is what you should do to set your profile and record your interest in Stage 1:

- Create an account on Telegram and Sign in.
- Find our Rethink Bot. You can search for @**rethinkbot** on Telegram or [Click here](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Frethinkbot&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEpmtvKu2st_fWdC-Zg9IJfgEqmLA) to find the bot.
- Type /**WIT**.
- If your profile already exists with us, the bot will record your interest in the WIT program and will directly your PRN and application link.
- If your profile does not exist with us, the bot will prompt you to create your profile. After you create the profile, type /**WIT** once more to record your interest and receive your PRN as well application link.

#### Note

- The bot might take a while to respond to your queries. Please be patient while you wait to create your profile.
- Using a random PRN or a PRN that belongs to someone else will make your application invalid.
